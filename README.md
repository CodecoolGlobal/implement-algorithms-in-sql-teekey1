# Implementing algorithms in SQL

The purpose of this exercise to make you practice PL-SQL and some algorithmic skills. You have to create functions to the well known Northwind database.

## Setup

If you missed the installation of Northwind database then [it's available here](https://github.com/pthom/northwind_psql). All the necessary information can be found in the [Northwind Schema assignment](https://learn.code.cool/advanced-data/#/../pages/sql/northwind-schema), do you remember?

## Tasks

You have to implement 3 different algorithms by using only the capability of PostgreSQL.

1. Breadth-first search
2. Soundex
3. Levenshtein distance

Make optimizations on the starting structure, and don't forget to comment your SQL and database!

You can find the detailed description [in the curriculum](https://learn.code.cool/advanced-data/#/../assignments/sql/sql-implementing-algorithms-in-sql) with some hints and useful resources to start with.

Please **don't** look up concrete solutions on the net, only use the textual algorithm provided on the Wikipedia page. It is your own interest to be able to implement an algorithm from its description.

Run the functions against the included dictionaries and try to improve the execution time with optimizations. Include all your tried solutions in the SQL file with commenting below the functions the execution times on the tested dictionaries.
